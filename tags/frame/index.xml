      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found it convenient to prototype SwiftUI animations in Xcode playgrounds, to quickly render custom views without getting into creating an entire project. The result is a single file that is easily shareable code-wise. Sharing the visual result however, is not as easy. There is no built-in way of capturing the rendered output. Resorting to the various screen-recording apps out there does not yield the expected quality, but also seems like a round-about way, when already working with a rendering engine directly.</description>
