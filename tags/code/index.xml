      <description>There seems to be at least some friction in writing code comments. And recently I&amp;rsquo;ve come more often across the claim:
&amp;ldquo;If code is written clearly enough, there is no need for comments.&amp;rdquo;
In my opinion, code is a projection of your mental model of what you are working on at a specific point in time. The clearer your thoughts, the more precise the mental model and code. This means that a fair amount of big-picture thinking is a prerequisite, in order to produce a clear and concise code contribution.</description>
